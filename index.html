                <p>Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Kingdom of Württemberg, German Empire. He
                    developed an interest in science and mathematics at an early age. Despite struggling with the rigid
                    educational system, he excelled in his studies and showed a deep curiosity about the nature of the
                    universe.</p>

                <h2 class="text-blue-600 font-lobster text-3xl">Education and Early Career</h2>
                <p>Einstein attended the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich, where he studied physics and
                    mathematics. After graduating in 1900, he struggled to find a teaching position and worked at the
                    Swiss Patent Office. During this time, he continued his scientific research and published several
                    groundbreaking papers.</p>

                <p>Einstein is best known for his theory of relativity and specifically the equation E=mc², which
                    describes the equivalence of energy and mass. His work has had a profound impact on the development
                    of modern physics. In 1921, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the
                    photoelectric effect, which was pivotal in establishing quantum theory.</p>

                <p>In his later years, Einstein was a prominent advocate for civil rights and was offered the presidency
                    of Israel, which he declined. He also spoke out against the use of nuclear weapons and worked
                    towards
                    global peace. He passed away on April 18, 1955, leaving behind a legacy that continues to influence
                    science and humanity.</p>

                    later divorced, and Einstein married his cousin Elsa Lowenthal in 1919. He was known for his
                    eccentric
                    personality, love of music, and deep sense of curiosity.</p>
